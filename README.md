# Space-Invaders
Built Space Invaders in class because I was bored and college had blocked the game site.

## Overview

Control your spaceship to shoot down waves of enemies. The enemies are organized in a matrix formation, and both the enemy behavior and the formation itself become more challenging with each level.

## Features

- **Matrix of Enemies:** Enemies are arranged in a grid that scales with each level.
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** Increased enemy speed, descent, and shooting frequency as levels progress.
- **Player and Enemy Shooting:** Both the player and enemies can shoot bullets.
- **Collision Detection:** Basic collision detection between bullets, enemies, and the player.
- **Game Over:** The game ends if an enemy bullet hits the player or if enemies descend too far.

## Controls

- **Left Arrow:** Move left
- **Right Arrow:** Move right
- **Space Bar:** Fire bullet
- **Escape:** Exit the game
